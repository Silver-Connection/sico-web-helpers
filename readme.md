## DataTables

Tweaks and improvments:

* Full Bootstrap 4 integration (themeing, pagination, buttons)
* Fixed Header works with tabs and fixed navigation bars
* Support for header templates in print view
* Add swap selected rows button
* Add support for small tables, just add `table-sm` in table`s class attribute
